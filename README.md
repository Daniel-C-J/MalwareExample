# MalwareExample
This is a repo for showing my skill in developing Malware in Python. (I can't show it all thoroughly to **prevent misuse**) 
<br>
> Frankly, I'm just trying to prove that I could develop a Malware —although it's just for fun and I'm bored... <br>
> Anyway I'll only show one type of frustating Malware.

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> 1. Run the Malware ***ethically***.
> 2. Do not spread it like a madman.
> 3. For testing do it in a **VM or Sandbox**.
>  
> ***I will not responsible for any damage caused by the Malware as I advised to execute it ethically. Thank you for your understanding.***

# red❌
redX is simply a Windows virus that spam process killing indirectly by its shortcut (`alt + f4`). I make it varies in levels based on how **advance** it is, not how **~~destructive~~** it is.
<br><br>
So here's a brief description for each level. 
<br>
- Level 1 - Simple and to eradicate it just restart one's PC and delete the program.

- Level 2 - Still simple but harder to eradicate since it copies itself to autorun program path. (**Don't try this one if not in VM or sandbox**)

- Level 3 - Have the ability to listen keystrokes, not intended to be a keylogger —but it is used as a feature to eradicate the Malware itself by typing a certain string. (default string: **j4nda**)

- Level 4 - Code obfuscation and encrypted, I won't publish it.

- Level 5 - Able to modify registry key, and more advance. Same as lvl4 I won't publish it.

> A lot more level actually exists, but I will not expose it.
