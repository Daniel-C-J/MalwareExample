This is a repo for displaying some of my skill in developing Malware. (I can't show it all thoroughly to **prevent misuse**)

# red❌
## Description
redX is simply a Windows virus that spam process killing indirectly by its shortcut (`alt + f4`). It is currently based on Python language, so you can build it using `pyinstaller` or other packages. It is quite destructive but will not effect any data at rest, but no guarantee for data in transit or data in use, so be careful, I've warned you.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I make it varies in levels based on how **advance** it is, not how **destructive** it is. <br>

So here's a brief description for each level:
<br>
- Level 1 - Simple. Open any program, and it will try to force kill it. To fully eradicate it just restart one's PC. (Then delete the Malware of course)

- Level 2 - Still simple but harder to eradicate since it copies itself to autorun program path. (**Don't try this one if not in VM or sandbox**)

- Level 3 - Have the ability to listen keystrokes, not intended to be a keylogger —but it is used as a feature to terminate the Malware itself by typing a certain string. (default string: **j4nda**)

- Level 4 - Code obfuscation, hidden file duplications. I won't publish it, too much disclosure.

- Level 5 - Able to modify registry key, and has additional feature to spam `tab + alt` to become a serial killer. Same as lvl4 I won't publish it.

> A lot more level actually exists, but again, I will not expose it.<br>
> I think this is enough for now. <br>

## Tested in
> - Windows 10 <br>

## Build with
> - Pyinstaller
> - Nuitka
