This is a repo for displaying some of my skill in developing Malware. (I can't show it all thoroughly to **prevent misuse**)

# red❌
## Description
redX is simply a Windows virus that spam process killing indirectly by its shortcut (`alt + f4`). It is currently based on Python language, so you can build it using `pyinstaller` or other packages. It is quite destructive but will not effect any data at rest, but no guarantee for data in transit or data in use, so be careful, I've warned you.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I make it varies in levels based on how **advance** it is, not how **destructive** it is. <br>

So here's a brief description for each level:
<br><br>
**Level 1**
- Very simple. Open any program, and it will try to force kill it.
- To fully eradicate it just restart one's PC. (Then delete the Malware to fully eradicate it)

**Level 2**
- Still simple.
- Harder to eradicate since it copies itself onto the windows autorun program path. (**Don't try this one if not in VM or sandbox**)

**Level 3**
- A little bit complex.
- Have the ability to listen keystrokes, but not intended as a keylogger.
- Typing certain string anywhere will terminate the Malware. (default string: **j4nda**)

**Level 4**
- Code obfuscation.
- Duplicating persistency.
- I won't publish it, too much disclosure.

**Level 5**
- Has the ability to deactivate Windows defender.
- Registry key manipulation.
- Same as lvl4 I won't publish it.

> A lot more level actually exists, but again, I will not expose it.<br>
> I think this is enough for now. <br>

## Tested in
> - Windows 10 


## Build it with
> - Pyinstaller
> - Py2exe
> - Or else...
