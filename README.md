# MalwareExample
Repo for showing my skill in developing Malware in Python. (Can't show it all to **prevent misuse**) <br>
Frankly, I'm just trying to prove that I could develop a Malware --although it's just for fun. I'll only show one type of frustating Malware.

redX is simply a Windows virus that spam process killing indirectly by its shortcut (`alt + f4`). I make it varies in levels based on how **advance** it is, not how destructive it is.
<br>
So here's the brief description for each level.
Level 1 - Simple and to eradicate it just restart one's pc and delete the program.

Level 2 - Still simple but harder to eradicate since it copies itself to autorun program path. (Don't try this one if not in VM or sandbox)

Level 3 - Have the ability to listen keystrokes, not intended to be a keylogger --but it is used as a feature to eradicate the Malware itself by typing a certain string. (default: j4nda)

Level 4 - Code obfuscation and encrypted, I won't publish it.

Level 5 - Able to modify registry key, and more advance. Same as lvl4 I won't publish it.

A lot more level actually exists, but i won't expose it.
